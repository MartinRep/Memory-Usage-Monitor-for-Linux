# Memory-Usage-Monitor-for-Linux
This script is a simple tool for monitoring the memory usage of processes containing a specific search term, and provides a way to track and analyze memory usage trends over time. The script runs indefinitely until the available disk space falls below a minimum threshold, at which point it stops running and exits.
